One or more of these can possibly help alleviate stuttering (mouse) and stocking/repeating kweys (keyboard):

1. Install patched mutter
2. Re-pair mouse (and keyboard) with dongle using Solaar
3. Use on only a single reciever for both devices
4. Block DDC
5. Turn off Bluetooth. (not sure of OS switch is sufficient)
